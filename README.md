# RL Games
RL agents play simple games.

- Tic Tac Toe: Model-free agent plays against another agent
- Frozen Lake (similar to gridworld) \
(a) generate a random instance of the frozen lake scenario given two inputs - the size of the lake (N) and the number of holes (M). \
(b) implement a Q-learning agent to find a path through the lake to the goal. Plot episode count vs total reward received by the agent \
(c) compute learning performance changes with respect to changes in N and M.
